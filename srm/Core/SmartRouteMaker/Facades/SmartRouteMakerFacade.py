    def plan_circular_route_flower(self, start_coordinates, max_length: int, elevation_diff_input: int, percentage_hard_input:int, options: dict) -> dict:

        """
        Generates a flower-like route structure on a given graph, where each leaf represents a circular path around the starting node.
        The algorithm places points on each petal, forming a route that connects them. The number of leafs, points per leaf, and other parameters can be adjusted.

        Parameters
        ----------
        - start_coordinates (tuple): The coordinates (latitude, longitude) of the starting point.
        - max_length (int): The maximum desired length of the generated route.
        - elevation_diff_input (int): The maximum desired elevation difference of the generated route.
        - options (dict): Additional options for analysis and visualization.

        Returns
        -------
        Output with all relative information for further analysis and visualization.

        Functionality
        -------------
        - Generates a circular pattern with a configurable number of leafs around the starting node.
        - Calculates the route by connecting points on each leaf.
        - Evaluates multiple paths and selects the one closest to the specified user input.
        - Performs path analysis, surface distribution analysis, and optionally visualizes the route.

        Note: This function is designed for route planning on a graph, considering geographical coordinates and various path attributes.

        Example Usage
